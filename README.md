## What is this
These are the Projects I made in x86-64/32/16 Assembly (Intel) during my Bachelor's course, Computer Organisation at TU Delft, just for fun.

>I didn't use any kind of external library for any of the projects listed here, everything you can see in the projects is hard coded by me, even the algorithms like (pseudo?)random generating numbers, time elapsed during the game and much more cool features including GUI in some projects like Snake (advanced) and graphics designing engine.

This includes 4 games (which I would share here); 1 GUI-ed game and 1 graphics-designing complex engine (which I am not sharing anywhere currently, except for sneak peeks) (╯°□°)╯彡┻━┻ 

## Contents
- SimpleSnake
- Snake with Graphics (no library)
- Graphics Designing Engine
- Gamble vs AI

## Why, no library?

Well, no real reason except for the fact that I wanted to make something that is purely hard coded by me and not use someone else's C program to do things with a bit less particularity

## How I made graphics without using any library

I used terminal that a simple Linux system has and (integrated?) it with video terminal used long back to animate things on terminal. I used special characters that were used in video terminal to make design patterns, unfold / fold / edit them and move them as we need.

## What pseudo random generating number algorithm?

Well, I could have used the simple rand() but I chose not to. Why? I don't know. The algorithm I used is very simple and clever (I think). I use the base number as 7, multiply it with the current time in milliseconds, get the third from last image and find it's square root to get the pseudo random number.

Cheesy and complicated? Yes. Fun? Hell yeah! :smile:


## This is how the simple snake game looks like:

## This is how the advanced VT100 graphics' snake game looks like:
