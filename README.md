# AssemblyGames
These are the games I made in x86-64 Assembly (Intel) during my Bachelor's course, Computer Organisation at TU Delft, just for fun.

This includes 3 games (which I would share here), 1 game which I would not and 1 graphics designing complex engine that took 80 or more hours to complete in pure assembly but it is forbidden
to share that engine as it has been sent to a competition.
