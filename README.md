# Assembly Games
These are the games I made in x86-64 Assembly (Intel) during my Bachelor's course, Computer Organisation at TU Delft, just for fun.

This includes 4 games (which I would share here), 1 game and 1 graphics designing complex engine that took 80 or more hours to complete in pure assembly but it is forbidden to share those, one because of being a project and another because of being
put in participation of a competition.

This is how the simple snake game looks like.
